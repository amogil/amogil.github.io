Fluxgate is a high-performance proxy between clients and LLM providers that centralizes routing, auth, and observability
while keeping latency overhead under a millisecond. It streams large payloads efficiently, protects provider keys from
clients, and lets you update configuration instantly without restarts, so teams can ship AI features without platform
friction.
